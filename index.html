        <div id="descp1">This website can be considered as a pandemic survival kit, complete with a basic overview of information you might
            find useful. In this website, you’ll find:</div>

        <div id="descp2"> At this point, with all the reminders to “stay at home” and to “frequently wash hands”, I think we all know that
            we’re in a pandemic (even if some people willingly ignore it). But how much do we really know about the problem
            we’re facing? That’s where this website comes in. The purpose of this website is to be a one-stop shop of tips
            on how to survive the pandemic, and to inform people about what’s actually happening in the pandemic.</div>
