            <h2>Why?</h2>
                <p>"Why should we stay informed about the virus?" Well, having the proper knowledge about the virus will lead to less misinformation spreading around, 
                    and it could possibly also reduce the chances of you getting infected and infecting others, because you'll know what you're dealing with.Knowing the 
                    proper information about the ongoing pandemic is important, which is why we'll be going over some tips and current news about COVID-19 in this webpage. 
                </p>
            <h2>Weeding Out Fake News</h2>
                <p>In order to stay informed during the pandemic, we must first make sure that the information we're getting is the real deal. This is why we need to know how
					to differentiate which articles and news are real, and which ones are fake and clickbait. The best way to do this is to make sure that we're getting information 
					from reliable information sources, or if we can't do that, we need to double check the sources of the article/news we're reading. 
				</p>
                <h3>Reliable Information Sources</h3>
                    <p>The World Health Organzation is currently the most reliable source of information about COVID-19. They constantly update their page on COVID-19 when
                    new discoveries are made. Their dedicated, <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub">COVID-19 Q&A 
                    page</a> has information about the pandemic and the virus (including, but not limited to: COVID-19 symptoms, contact tracing, how COVID-19 affects food, etc.) 
                    Aside from that, many Philippine news sources also get their information from WHO. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>For local information sources, the Department of Health (DOH)'s <a href="https://doh.gov.ph/">website</a> shows news about COVID-19 in the Philippines. They've
                    covered topics like adjusting to the "new normal", statistics on COVID-19 cases, and updates on vaccines.</p>
            <h2>Current Number of COVID-19 Cases</h2>
                <h3> Around The World</h3>
                    <p>As of the making of this website, there has been <span>99,129,885</span> total confirmed cases around the world. <span>54,681,724</span> of these cases have 
                    already recovered. Sadly, there were also <span>2,127,833</span> deaths among those numbers.</p>
                <h3>In the Philippines</h3>
                    <p>Currently, the Philippines has <span>575,392</span> total COVID-19 cases, making it the 32nd country in the world with the most number of COVID-19 positive patients.
                       Among those 575,392 total COVID cases, <span>467,886</span> of them have recovered while <span>10,190</span> patients have died. 
                    </p>
            <h2>Advancements in COVID-19</h2>
                <p>Multiple advancements and discoveries have already been made about COVID-19 as of the making of this website, some of these are:</p>
                <h3>Development of a vaccine</h3>
                    <p>Many vaccines against COVID-19 have already been made; some of these are <span>the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine</span>, with a 95% efficacy rate, and 
                    <span>Moderna's vaccine</span>, with a 94.1% efficacy rate. Other COVID-19 vaccines include the AstraZeneca vaccine, Janssen's COVID-19 vaccine, and Novavax's 
                    vaccine. </p>
                    <p>Most (if not, all) of these vaccines have to be taken twice, 21 days apart; people have also been noted to experience flu-like side-effects 1-2 days after 
                        receiving the shot. 
                    </p>
                <h3>Copper Masks Don't Work</h3>
                    <p>While people may have thought that copper masks would work better against the vaccine due to their reactive ions against microbes, studies have shown that 
                        copper masks <span>do not</span> work well against the virus, or at least, not any better than a regular face mask. Actually, the copper masks could be worse 
                        at preventing infection from the virus. This is especially true if copper masks get washed or disinfected often, which strips them of their ions that supposedly 
                        kills COVID-19.
