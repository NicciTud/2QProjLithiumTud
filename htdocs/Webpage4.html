				<h2>The Dos and Don'ts of Quarantine</h2>
					<h3>How to Avoid Getting Infected</h3>
						<p>Take precautions especially when meeting people. These precautions include <span>physical distancing</span> (maintaining at least 1 meter of distance between
						people), <span>wearing a mask properly</span> (covering the nose as well), <span>regularly washing or sanitizing your hands</span> (using the proper handwashing technique 
						with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or using an alcohol based sanitizer),<span>keeping rooms well-ventilated</span>, <span>coughing into your elbow or a tissue
						</span>, and just <span>avoiding crowds, close contact, and gatherings</span> in general.</p>
					<h3>How to Avoid Infecting Others</h3>
						<p>Regardless of whether you think you have COVID-19 or not, it's important <span>not to go out unnecessarily</span>, and <span> not to hold large group gatherings</span>.
						<span>avoid touching surfaces</span> as well, not only to protect yourself, but also to protect others in the case that you're infected. The steps on what to do if you think
						you've contracted COVID-19 will be discussed in the next webpage.</p>
				<h2>Why and how do these work?</h2>
				<p>These precautions were given to lessen the chance of getting infected and infecting others. But why do these precautions work? Well, here's the scientifically tried and tested reasons
					why:</p>
					<h3>Physical Distancing and Avoiding Mass Gatherings</h3>
						<p>It is important to maintain physical distancing because it lessens the risk of us inhaling fluid particles whenever we talk with someone, or whenever someone coughs or sneezes
							near us. The distance of at least 1 meter is because that's typically how far aerosols and fluid particles travel in the air from a person. </p>
					<h3>Wearing a mask properly</h3>
						<p>Masks prevent us from inhaling small particles that could infect us. It would also work the other way around, protecting other people from particles that we may make.
							<span>Surgical or medical masks</span> work especially well because they have filtration layers in the middle of its 3 main layers. it is very effective in resisting 
							and catching fluid particles, which would semi-filter the air you breathe (lessens the chance of getting COVID-19).
						</p>
					<h3>Regular hand washing and sanitizing</h3>
						<p>This reduces the germs and viruses that you may have come into contact with through your hands.</p>
					<h3>Avoid touching surfaces</h3>
						<p>This relates to the previous point of possibly getting the virus on your hands. To minimize the chance of contracting and spreading the virus, avoid touching surfaces 
							like tables, metals, <span>your face</span>, and many more. Surfaces should also be regularly disinfected.
						</p>
					<h3>Keeping rooms well-ventilated</h3>
						<p>Keeping rooms well-ventilated reduces the chance of inhaling particles that could have been lingering in the room.</p>
					<h3>Coughing into a tissue or your elbow</h3>
						<p>Because coughing creates fluid paticles that could possibly infect someone, it would be better to cough into a tissue or your elbow. Coughing into your elbow would redduce the chances
							of you infecting someone else, mainly because the elbow is rarely used in touching surfaces, unlike the hands. As for the tissue, the fluid particles would be abbsorbed quicker, and it
							 can be thrown away.
						</p>
