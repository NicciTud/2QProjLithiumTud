			<h2>What to do</h2>
				<p>If you think you have COVID-19, you should <span>contact a medical professional</span> to see when it would be possible for you to take a test. Aside from that, it's 
					important to  quarantine yourself away from others for 14 days, and to monitor your symptoms. Wait for the advice of the health professional to determine 
					the best course of action.
				</p>
			<h2>How to prevent it from spreading</h2>
				<p>As said in the previous webpage, it's important to <span>reeduce contact between yourself and surfaces or other people</span>. Aside from that, you should <span>cooperate with the contact-
					tracing procedures</span> set in order to stop the spread of the virus, and to see who may have gotten it as well. Following these procedures would lessen the spread of COVID-19, since 
					the possibly infected people will be quarantined immediately, which would reduce the number of people who could infect others due to contact.
